# Dolhouse

## What is Dolhouse?
*Dolhouse* is a project that aims to be a AIO library for working with files from Luigi's Mansion. It's currently in **very early development** and is not really recommended for general use.

## How do I use it?
To start using *Dolhouse*, you simply include the dll file in your project and you're good to go. To get the newest features, download the source code and build the dll yourself. If something breaks or doesn't work as intended, please let me know.
