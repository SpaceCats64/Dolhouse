# Dolhouse

## What is Dolhouse?
*Dolhouse* is a project that aims to be a AIO library for working with files from Luigi's Mansion. It's currently in **very early development** and is not really recommended for general use.

------

## How do I use it?
To start using *Dolhouse*, you simply include the dll file in your project and you're good to go. To get the newest features, download the source code and build the dll yourself. If something breaks or doesn't work as intended, please let me know.

------

## Progress
As stated earlier, *Dolhouse* is still in it's **very early stages of development**. So most of the work now revolves around creating a solid foundation to build the rest of the library upon. But since you're curious, have a look below:
- Binary Reader (90%, Almost complete)
- Binary Writer (10%, Started)
- JMP Reading (90%, Almost complete)
- JMP Writing (0%, Not started)

The percentages above are **estimates**, more features will be added above once implemented.
